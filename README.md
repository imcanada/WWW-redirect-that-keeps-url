# WWW-redirect-that-keeps-url
This code allows you to redirect from yourdomain.com to www.yourdomain.com and keep the path. So if you go to yourdomain.com/contact it redirects to www.yourdomain.com/contact
This project was made out of frustration of cloudflare not working to do the same basic thing when trying to redirect to www.mysite.com because google sites doesn't support naked domains.

# Installation
1. Upload the files to the non-www version of your webpage.
2. Rename l.htaccess to .htaccess
3. Open the two html files and change all example.com's & www.example.com's to your domain (remember the www in front)
4. Done, now your traffic will go directly to your www version.
